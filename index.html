<h1>Ben McKay - Portfolio of GIS Work</h1>
<p> I am a undergraduate of University of Auckland, with a double major in Marine Science and Geographic Information
  Science (GIS). Appended below are various examples of GIS work and other programming work I've done during the course
  of my study.

<h2> Folium Map displaying various Airbnb statistics in San Francisco </h2>
<p><iframe src="BNB.html" width="800" height="400" resize="both"></iframe></p>
<p>Following the sourcing of airbnb data from <a href ="http://insideairbnb.com/san-francisco">InsideAirbnb</a>,
  I was able to perform a query using PostgreSQL to create a Folium map with the Folium package, with the following
  code being used to produce the map:<p/>

<h2>Matplotlib Map displaying tree census data (red) in New York City for 1995 (left) and 2015 (right)</h2>

       align="right"
       width="50%"

</p>

<p>The Matplotlib package was also utilised within PostgreSQL <b> Or python double check with Dad </b> to produce maps,
  as seen above with two maps showing the change in tree distribution in New York City between 1995 and 2015 using tree
  census data sourced from <a href ="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nycparks/tree-census">Kaggle</a>.</p>

<h3>Multi-Criteria Evaluation (ArcMap)</h3>
<p>I performed a Multi-Criteria Evaluation on the</p>

<h2>Network Analysis (ArcMap)</h2>
<p>I performed a network analysis on Mt Eden Train Station in Auckland, NZ to calculate the catchment area to identify
  how many people would walk to the train station.Shoreline Change Analysis (ArcMap) I performed an analysis on shoreline
  change at Whangamata Beach (left) and further north of Whangamata (right) to identify the pattern of movement by
  georeferencing historical aerial photographs.</p>
<p>
        <img width="50%" alt="Whanga Beach" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109936302/182306331-f54efcb3-b373-4bbf-b7a7-90b1b2f97af7.png" align="left"  height="400">
        <img width="50%" alt="North Whanga" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109936302/182306419-5ab24284-3f23-4d4d-827d-25ca7efd8079.png" align="right"  height="400">
</p>
<p>One of the tools used was DSAS (Digital Shoreline Analysis System) which displayed the Net Shoreline Movement (m)
  results in 10m transects over the approximate 80 year period of aerial photographs (1944 - 2020). Allowing me to
  identify the rate of either accretion (blue) or erosion (red) that had occurred at Whangamata.</p>

</p>
<h2>Google Earth Engine</h2>
<p>Google Earth Engine was utilised to perform a supervised classification - in which the algorithm was trained by
  myself - on Toshka Lakes across 3 different land cover types: Land (yellow), Agriculture (green), and Water (blue).
<b>INSERT IMAGE OF 4 IMAGES</b>
<br><br>Google Earth Engine was - through supervised classifications - used to produce maps that displayed
  changes in the aforementioned land cover types across several years.

</p>
<p>R was used within Marine Science to create plots such as the forest plot seen above. This forest plot was used for a
  meta-analysis report to identify any patterns between similar studies for consistent response </p>
