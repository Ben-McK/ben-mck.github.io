Following the sourcing of airbnb data from <a href ="http://insideairbnb.com/san-francisco">InsideAirbnb</a>, I was able to perform a query using PostgreSQL to create a Folium map with the Folium package, with the following code being used to produce the map:

<br><br><br>The Matplotlib package was also utilised to produce maps, as seen above with two maps showing the change in tree distribution in New York City between 1995 and 2015 using tree census data sourced from <a href ="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nycparks/tree-census">Kaggle</a>.
